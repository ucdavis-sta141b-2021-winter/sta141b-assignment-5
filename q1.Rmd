In this question, you will be asked to use Yelp API to perform some tasks.

First, you will need to register an app on Yelp platform: https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app

Copy the API key in the file `.Renviron` and do not push it to github!


##### (a) Use the "search" endpoint to search for Davis's "Burgers and Brew" and get its `id`.



##### (b) Use the "detail" endpoint to fetch "Burgers and Brew"'s business hour.



##### (c) By using the reviews endpoint, get some reviews for "Burgers and Brew".

PS: there is a hard limitation that only 3 reviews are returned.
